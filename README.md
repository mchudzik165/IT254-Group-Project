Project Concept:
Our project concept is a basic home security system powered by AI that uses face detection to let in and stop individuals. It'll warn in the case of an individual that tried to scan in but did so unsuccessfully. We haven't gotten to far in the concept, but it'll most likely flash a light that signals there has been a error scanning the individual's face. The AI will be trained based on our own faces and possibly even on our face expressions. Using face expressions, it will detect the mood or expression a person trying to scan in is safe to let in or not. A person smiling for example will be allowed in and let the door open along with signal with a LED meaning "OK". A person that looks upset/AI deems to be mad or angry will not let in the person and keep the door closed along with signalling a LED to show an error or access denied. The system concept itself seems pretty simple hardware wise, however, programming it may lead into some difficulties. 

Items List: (Not final)
We are most likely planning to use Google Teachable Machine, so we will need:
- A desktop camera
- Servo/s for the door opening system (?)
- Sensor of some sort to ensure door is closed
- Small breadboard
- LED light nodes to check status
